## What we will cover

- What is BDD
- How do you work in a BDD style
- What tools do you need?

## Notes

BDD or Behavior driven development is a style of working where you define features in steps and then write tests
that run against your application to verify if a feature is working in the way specified.

These tests are written in Gherkin which is a code like language that is converted in to test steps that can then
be implemented by developers to perform the action described in the step.
